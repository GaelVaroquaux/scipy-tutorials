GUARD: 'Allo, daffy English kaniggets and Monsieur Arthur-King, who is
      afraid of a duck, you know!  So, we French fellows out-wit you a
      second time!
 
ARTHUR: How dare you profane this place with your presence!?  I
      command you, in the name of the Knights of Camelot, to open the
      doors of this sacred castle, to which God himself has guided us!

GUARD: How you English say, I one more time-a unclog my nose in your
      direction, sons of a window-dresser!  So, you think you could
      out-clever us French folk with your silly knees-bent running
      about advancing behavior! I wave my private parts at your
      aunties, you heaving lot of second-hand electric donkey bottom
      biters.

ARTHUR: In the name of the Lord, we demand entrance to this sacred
      castle!

GUARD: No chance, English bedwetting types.  I burst my pimples at you
      and call your daughter an unrequested silly thing.  You
      tiny-brained wipers of other people's bottoms!
